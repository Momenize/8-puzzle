🧩 8-Puzzle Solver Game
-

Welcome to the 8-Puzzle Solver Game! 🎉 This project is built in C# using Avalonia. It's a fun and educational journey into solving the classic 8-puzzle problem, designed to showcase algorithm design and problem-solving skills.

    Note: This is a school project created to help me ace my Design Algorithms course. 😅

✨ Features to Be Added

    -I'd like to improve the app's user interface, whenever I had the time, off course. 
    -I'd also like to fix problems with the shuffle method, since it doesn't work so right sometimes.
    -Also, the method I've come up with to solve the puzzle using Branch and Bound has to improve, because it takes so much time and off course, doesn't give the satisfying result for complexly-shuffled puzzles.
